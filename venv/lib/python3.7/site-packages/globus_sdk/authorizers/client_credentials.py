class ClientCredentialsAuthorizer(RenewingAuthorizer):
    """
    Implementation of a RenewingAuthorizer that renews confidential app client
    Access Tokens using a ConfidentialAppAuthClient and a set of scopes to
    fetch a new Access Token when the old one expires.

    Example usage looks something like this:

    >>> import globus_sdk
    >>> confidential_client = globus_sdk.ConfidentialAppAuthClient(
        client_id=..., client_secret=...)
    >>> scopes = "..."
    >>> cc_authorizer = globus_sdk.ClientCredentialsAuthorizer(
    >>>     confidential_client, scopes)
    >>> # create a new client
    >>> transfer_client = globus_sdk.TransferClient(authorizer=cc_authorizer)

    any client that inherits from :class:`BaseClient <globus_sdk.BaseClient>`
    should be able to use a ClientCredentialsAuthorizer to act as
    the client itself.

    **Parameters**

        ``confidential_client`` (:class:`ConfidentialAppAuthClient\
        <globus_sdk.ConfidentialAppAuthClient>`)
          ``ConfidentialAppAuthClient`` with a valid id and client secret

        ``scopes`` (*string*)
          A string of space-separated scope names being requested for the
          access tokens that will be used for the Authorization header.
          These scopes must all be for the same resource server, or else
          the token response will have multiple access tokens.

        ``access_token`` (*string*)
          Initial Access Token to use, only used if ``expires_at`` is also set.
          Must be requested with the same set of scopes passed to this
          authorizer.

        ``expires_at`` (*int*)
          Expiration time for the starting ``access_token`` expressed as a
          POSIX timestamp (i.e. seconds since the epoch)

        ``on_refresh`` (*callable*)
          A callback which is triggered any time this authorizer fetches a new
          access_token. The ``on_refresh`` callable is invoked on the
          :class:`OAuthTokenResponse \
                  <globus_sdk.auth.token_response.OAuthTokenResponse>`
          object resulting from the token being refreshed.
          It should take only one argument, the token response object.

          This is useful for implementing storage for Access Tokens, as the
          ``on_refresh`` callback can be used to update the Access Tokens and
          their expiration times.
