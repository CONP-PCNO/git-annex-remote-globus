        Check if the document lists known types of activation that can be done
        through the web. If this returns ``False``, it means that the endpoint
        is of a highly unusual type, and you should directly inspect the
        response's ``data`` attribute to see what is required. Sending users to
        the web page for activation is also a fairly safe action to take.
        Note that ``ActivationRequirementsResponse.supports_auto_activation``
        directly implies
        ``ActivationRequirementsResponse.supports_web_activation``, so these
        are *not* exclusive.

        For example,

        >>> tc = TransferClient(...)

        Check if the Endpoint will be active until some time in the future,
        given as an integer number of seconds.
        When ``relative_time=False``, the ``time_seconds`` is interpreted as a
        POSIX timestamp.

        This supports queries using both relative and absolute timestamps to
        better support a wide range of use cases. For example, if I have a task
        that I know will typically take N seconds, and I want an M second
        safety margin:

        >>> num_secs_allowed = N + M
        >>> tc = TransferClient(...)
        >>> reqs_doc = tc.endpoint_get_activation_requirements(...)
        >>> if not reqs_doc.active_until(num_secs_allowed):
        >>>     raise Exception("Endpoint won't be active long enough")
        >>> ...

        or, alternatively, if I know that the endpoint must be active until
        October 18th, 2016 for my tasks to complete:

        >>> oct18_2016 = 1476803436
        >>> tc = TransferClient(...)
        >>> reqs_doc = tc.endpoint_get_activation_requirements(...)

        >>> ...

        **Parameters**

          ``time_seconds``
            Integer number of seconds into the future.

          ``relative_time``
            Defaults to True. When False, ``time_seconds`` is treated as a
            POSIX timestamp (i.e. seconds since epoch as an integer) instead of
            its ordinary behavior.
