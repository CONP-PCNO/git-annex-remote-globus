class GlobusOAuthFlowManager(object):
    """
    An abstract class definition that defines the interface for the Flow
    Managers for Globus Auth.
    Flow Managers are really just bundles of parameters to Globus Auth's OAuth2
    mechanisms, along with some useful utility methods.
    Primarily they can be used as a simple way of tracking small amounts of
    state in your application as it leverages Globus Auth for authentication.

    For sophisticated use cases, the provided Flow Managers will *NOT* be
    sufficient, but you should consider the provided objects a model.

    This way of managing OAuth2 flows is inspired by
    `oauth2client <https://github.com/google/oauth2client>`_. However, because
    ``oauth2client`` has an uncertain future (as of 2016-08-31), and we would
    have to wrap it in order to provide a clean API surface anyway, we
    implement our own set of Flow objects.

        redirected to the URL or provided with a link.
