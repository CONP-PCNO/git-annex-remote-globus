        ``requested_scopes``

        **Parameters**

            ``redirect_uri`` (*string*)
              The page that users should be directed to after authenticating at
              the authorize URL. Required.

            ``requested_scopes`` (*iterable* or *string*)
              The scopes on the token(s) being requested, as a space-separated
              string or an iterable of strings. Defaults to ``openid profile
              email urn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all``

            ``state`` (*string*)
              This is a way of your application passing information back to
              itself in the course of the OAuth flow. Because the user will
              navigate away from your application to complete the flow, this
              parameter lets you pass an arbitrary string from the starting
              page to the ``redirect_uri``

            ``refresh_tokens`` (*bool*)
              When True, request refresh tokens in addition to access tokens

        **Examples**

        You can see an example of this flow :ref:`in the usage examples

        Does a `Dependent Token Grant
        <https://docs.globus.org/api/auth/reference/#dependent_token_grant_post_v2_oauth2_token>`_
        against Globus Auth.
        This exchanges a token given to this client for a new set of tokens
        which give it access to resource servers on which it depends.
        This grant type is intended for use by Resource Servers playing out the
        following scenario:

          1. User has tokens for Service A, but Service A requires access to
             Service B on behalf of the user
          2. Service B should not see tokens scoped for Service A
          3. Service A therefore requests tokens scoped only for Service B,
             based on tokens which were originally scoped for Service A...

        In order to do this exchange, the tokens for Service A must have scopes
        which depend on scopes for Service B (the services' scopes must encode
        their relationship). As long as that is the case, Service A can use
        this Grant to get those "Dependent" or "Downstream" tokens for Service
        B.

          ``token`` (*string*)
            An Access Token as a raw string, being exchanged.
