    This type of ``AuthClient`` is used to represent a Native App's
    communications with Globus Auth.
    It requires a Client ID, and cannot take an ``authorizer``.

    Native Apps are applications, like the Globus CLI, which are run
    client-side and therefore cannot keep secrets. Unable to possess client
    credentials, several Globus Auth interactions have to be specialized to
    accommodate the absence of a secret.

    Any keyword arguments given are passed through to the ``AuthClient``
    constructor.

        Starts a Native App OAuth2 flow.

        This is done internally by instantiating a
        :class:`GlobusNativeAppFlowManager
        <globus_sdk.auth.GlobusNativeAppFlowManager>`

        While the flow is in progress, the ``NativeAppAuthClient`` becomes
        non thread-safe as temporary state is stored during the flow.

        **Parameters**

            ``requested_scopes`` (*iterable* or *string*)
              The scopes on the token(s) being requested, as a space-separated
              string or iterable of strings. Defaults to ``openid profile email
              urn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all``

            ``redirect_uri`` (*string*)
              The page that users should be directed to after authenticating at
              the authorize URL. Defaults to
              'https://auth.globus.org/v2/web/auth-code', which displays the
              resulting ``auth_code`` for users to copy-paste back into your
              application (and thereby be passed back to the
              ``GlobusNativeAppFlowManager``)

            ``state`` (*string*)
              Typically is not meaningful in the Native App Grant flow, but you
              may have a specialized use case for it. The ``redirect_uri`` page
              will have this included in a query parameter, so you can use it
              to pass information to that page. It defaults to the string
              '_default'

            ``verifier`` (*string*)
              A secret used for the Native App flow. It will by default be a
              freshly generated random string, known only to this
              ``GlobusNativeAppFlowManager`` instance

            ``refresh_tokens`` (*bool*)
              When True, request refresh tokens in addition to access tokens

            ``prefill_named_grant`` (*string*)
              Optionally prefill the named grant label on the consent page

        **Examples**

        You can see an example of this flow :ref:`in the usage examples
        <examples_native_app_login>`
